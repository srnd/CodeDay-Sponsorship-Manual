Getting employees involved in the community can be a great way to increase their engagement and work satisfaction, and CodeDay provides a number of great opportunities for all commitment levels.

(If your company is just starting a volunteerism program, we recommend heavily promoting the judging opportunity: past sponsors have found that it's an easy ask for new volunteers.)

# Recruiting

We can manage the volunteer recruitment process: just can have employees sign up at https://codeday.org/volunteer (have them use their work email if you'd like statistics).

Alternatively, you can send us an Excel sheet listing: first name, last name, email, and judge or mentor. Please email the sheet to volunteer@codeday.org

We recommend you start recruiting volunteers six weeks before CodeDay. For the best experience, employees should sign up at least two weeks prior to CodeDay, however our hard cut-off for volunteers is the Wednesday prior to CodeDay.

Feel free to copy the text below to help recruit volunteers.

# Blurb

CodeDay is a 24-hour, tech event which gets diverse students to start coding. Over 70% of attendees with no prior experience continue programming after.

We're looking for judges and mentors to help students have a great and successful weekend.

**If you're interested, register at codeday.org/volunteer, or just reply to this email with your desired position.**

**(Insert date and location of your sponsored event.)**

## Low Commitment: Judging

CodeDay judges get to talk to student teams 1-1 and try their apps and games, watch student presentations, and then present several awards on the basis of creativity, effort, and polish. It's a low-pressure way to meet students in the community.

**Time:** Sunday of the event, from 9am through noon.  
**Requirements:** None  
**Training:** We send judges a one-page guide the week before the event, and brief them when they arrive. No additional training is needed.

## Medium Commitment: Mentoring

Mentors help students learn to make great projects. They patrol an assigned section of the event, looking for students experiencing problems. Help is usually needed with higher-level problems -- more "how should I approach this problem" and less "how do I use this particular technology".

**Time:** Saturday of the event; two-hour shifts starting at 2pm.  
**Requirements:** Technical, design, or product management job role or background
**Training:** We request that first-time mentors join a one-hour training call in the two weeks prior to the event.
