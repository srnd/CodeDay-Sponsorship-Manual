# Promoting Your Support

Feel free to share your organization's support of CodeDay on social media, your mailing list, or internally! We have a few resources to make that easier:

## Photo Filters

We've made it easy to add #CodeDay to your social media profile pictures: just select a filter and upload your logo [here,](https://codeday.org/share?staff) then download the result!

## CodeDay Photos

If you need a photo for a tweet, newsletter, etc, feel free to use any from our [press page.](https://srnd.org/press)

## Hashtags

Use the hashtag #CodeDay for maximum visibility. We often have tweets with #CodeDay displayed on the projector at events.

We recommend you say something about why your company supports inclusivity or tech education in text of the post. We also regularly repost and retweet posts from our sponsors.
