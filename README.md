Welcome! If you're reading this, it's likely because you've signed on to support diverse CS education by becoming a CodeDay sponsor.

Thank you! You're the best!

We created this guide to give you an overview of how to make the most of your CodeDay sponsorship. It's broken up into sections for each of the usual perks we provide to sponsors; some might not apply to you, and there might be a few differences between what this guide expects and what specifically you were promised in exchange for your support. _Your conversations with CodeDay staff have priority over anything in this guide._

If you've sponsored other events like this before, you might already have some idea of what to expect. We still recommend you at least skim the sections relevant to your sponsorship; CodeDay has some differences from a traditional hackathon.
